# BGL-ML-project
Codes and data for the BGL-ML research project, which corresponds to the paper: "Collider phenomenology of new scalars from multi-Higgs models" by myself and collaborators. arXiv:00000.0000

Refs: Some references for direct searches at the LHC that were relevant for the paper

Param_Cards_MG5: Parameters cards to be used in MadGraph, for all 1sigma and 2sigma benchmark points 

TMVA: Contains the C macros to run the TMVA analysis. Contains some data (with small stastitics), use only purpose is to test the codes. Requires ROOT to run. Containts do_read, which converts .csv files to ROOT tuples. Contains do_TMVA_A3_single_prod_root6, which runs the TMVA code
