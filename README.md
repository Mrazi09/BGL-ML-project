# BGL-ML-project
Codes and data for the BGL-ML research project, which corresponds to the paper: "Collider phenomenology of new scalars from multi-Higgs models" by myself (João Pedro Pino Gonçalves) and collaborators (António Morais, António Onofre, Pedro Ferreira, Felipe F. Freitas, Vasileios Vatellis and Roman Pasechnik). arXiv:00000.0000

**Refs**: Some references for direct searches at the LHC that were relevant for the paper

**Param_Cards_MG5**: Parameters cards to be used in MadGraph, for all 1sigma and 2sigma benchmark points 

**TMVA**: Contains the C macros to run the TMVA analysis. Contains some data inside, but the data samples are are very small and they are only meant for testing purposes !!!! In the **Data** folder, there are some .csv's with greater statistics. Requires ROOT to run. Containts do_read, which converts .txt files to ROOT tuples. Contains do_TMVA_A3_single_prod_root6, which runs the TMVA code

**Root analysis**: Contains jupyter notebooks for the analysis. A3_singleproduction.ipynb contains the main root analysis based on PyROOT. It reads a root file generated by Delphes and extract data. It also contains some plotting codes. To_txt.ipynb contains the main code for converting .csv files into .txt files needed for the ROOT TMVA framework. There is also some plotting codes for the TMVA root output

**BGL_UFO_py3**: Contains the UFO files, as well as an example parameter card (restrict_default.dat) to run Monte Carlo simulations in MadGraph. Python3 version

**BGL_UFO_py3**: Contains the UFO files, as well as an example parameter card (restrict_default.dat) to run Monte Carlo simulations in MadGraph. Python2 version

**MadGraph_bash**: Contains some example scripts to run MadGraph. They are designed to run in Aveiro's local computer cluster. make_scripts_1sigma.sh contains the code to get the cross-section for each of the 1sigma points for the signal topology. Inside the Signal folder, it contains the main codes to run MadGraph+Pythia8+Delphes chain for the signal, and inside Folders_1.sh it contains the MadGraph syntax for event generation. Equivalently, inside the Z_plus_jets folder we have the codes for the Z plus jets background. The MadGraph syntax is the Folders.sh file.
There is also run_\*.sh codes which were used to simulate 1 million events for z+jets and signal. The code generated 10 samples, each with 100k events

**Data**: Contains .csv tables with the data used in the analysis. Corresponds to the events that survive from the 1M points generated.
