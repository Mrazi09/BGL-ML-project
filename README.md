# BGL-ML-project
Codes and data for the BGL-ML research project, which corresponds to the paper: "Collider phenomenology of new scalars from multi-Higgs models" by myself and collaborators. arXiv:00000.0000

**Refs**: Some references for direct searches at the LHC that were relevant for the paper

**Param_Cards_MG5**: Parameters cards to be used in MadGraph, for all 1sigma and 2sigma benchmark points 

**TMVA**: Contains the C macros to run the TMVA analysis. Contains some data. The data samples are very small and they are only meant for testing purposes !!!! Requires ROOT to run. Containts do_read, which converts .txt files to ROOT tuples. Contains do_TMVA_A3_single_prod_root6, which runs the TMVA code

**Root analysis**: Contains jupyter notebooks for the analysis. A3_singleproduction.ipynb contains the main root analysis. It reads a root file generated by Delphes and extract data. It also contains some plotting codes. To_txt.ipynb contains the main code for converting .csv files into .txt files needed for the ROOT TMVA framework. It also plotting codes for the TMVA root output

**BGL_UFO_py3**: Contains the UFO files, as well as example parameter card (restrict_default.dat) to run Monte Carlo simulations in MadGraph. Python3 version

**BGL_UFO_py3**: Contains the UFO files, as well as example parameter card (restrict_default.dat) to run Monte Carlo simulations in MadGraph. Python2 version
