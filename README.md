# BGL-ML-project
Codes and data for the BGL-ML research project, which corresponds to the paper: "Collider phenomenology of new scalars in a flavoured multi-Higgs models" by myself (João Pedro Pino Gonçalves) and collaborators (Pedro M. Ferreira, António Morais, António Onofre, Roman Pasechnik and Vasileios Vatellis). arXiv:00000.0000

**Param_Cards_MG5**: Parameters cards to be used in MadGraph, for all 1sigma and 2sigma benchmark points. While I haved tested a lot of the cards, I have not tested every single card, so if you find any bugs with the cards and can't seem to fix it, please contact me.

**BGL_UFO_py3**: Contains the UFO files, as well as an example parameter card (restrict_default.dat) to run Monte Carlo simulations in MadGraph. Python3 version

**BGL_UFO_py3**: Contains the UFO files, as well as an example parameter card (restrict_default.dat) to run Monte Carlo simulations in MadGraph. Python2 version

**Data**: Contains .csv tables with the data used in the analysis. Corresponds to the events that survive the cuts from the 1M points generated.

**Benchmark_cards**: Cards for the benchmarks H1, H2, H3, H4, H5 and H6 that were mentioned in the paper. Includes the MadGprah cards that can be used for the Monte Carlo simulations, as well as the SPheno outputs, where one can read the branching fractions for the scalar fields.
